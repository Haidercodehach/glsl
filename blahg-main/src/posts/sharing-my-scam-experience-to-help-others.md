As an indie developer, I have faced my fair share of challenges. From technical hurdles to marketing roadblocks, the journey has been anything but smooth. However, one experience that left me feeling particularly frustrated and vulnerable was my recent encounter with Gumroad.

## The Beginning
Let me introduce myself. My name is Haider Aftab, and I am a solo developer who started my journey just a year ago. Fresh out of college, I dove headfirst into the world of mobile game development, creating two small projects to hone my skills.

Driven by a desire to expand my horizons, I decided to venture into web development. After completing my latest project, [Allais](https://www.allais.site/), I was eager to share it with the world. I started documenting my progress and building a community around the project, excited about the potential it held.
## The First User
One day, after sharing my project, I received my first user. It was an exhilarating moment. The validation and encouragement from that single user fueled my motivation and determination. I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off.

Since Stripe was not available in my country, I opted for Gumroad as a payment processor. The platform seemed straightforward, and it integrated seamlessly with my project. Everything was going smoothly until I encountered an unexpected roadblock.

Without any warning or explanation, Gumroad suspended my account. I was baffled and confused. I had followed all their guidelines and hadn't violated any terms of service. I immediately reached out to their support team, sending numerous emails, but I received no response.

## The Payment Dilemma 
When I tried to access my payout page, it initially indicated that I would be paid on August 30th. However, much to my dismay, Gumroad later updated the payment date to September 6th. This delay was causing significant financial strain, as I had relied on the income from my project to support my development efforts.
Frustrated and uncertain about Gumroad's intentions, I decided to switch my payment system to Patreon. The transition wasn't without its challenges, but it ultimately proved to be a more reliable and supportive platform.
## Lessons Learned
This experience taught me several valuable lessons:

- Diversify Payment Options: Relying solely on one payment processor can be risky. Having multiple options can help mitigate the impact of unexpected issues.
- Communicate Proactively: When encountering problems, it's essential to be persistent and proactive in your communication. Don't hesitate to reach out to support teams or seek assistance from online communities.
- Build a Community: A strong community can provide support, encouragement, and alternative solutions during challenging times. Engaging with your audience and fostering a sense of belonging can be invaluable.
- Be Patient and Persistent: Dealing with customer support can be frustrating, but it's important to remain patient and persistent. Keep following up and advocating for your case.

While this experience was undoubtedly challenging, it has also strengthened my resolve as an indie developer. I've learned to be more cautious and adaptable in my business practices. Moving forward, I'll continue to focus on building a sustainable and resilient development career.
## Conclusion

My encounter with Gumroad serves as a cautionary tale for other indie developers. It's essential to be aware of the potential risks associated with payment processors and to have contingency plans in place. By learning from my mistakes and sharing my experiences, I hope to help others navigate the challenges of the indie development landscape.
