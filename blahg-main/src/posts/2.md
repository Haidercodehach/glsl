### Under the Hood: Input and Output Structures

Imagine a pixel shader as a tiny artist working on an assembly line. It receives raw materials (inputs) and transforms them into the final product (output). Here's a breakdown of these structures:

- **Inputs:** These are the pieces of information the pixel shader receives from the graphics pipeline. They act as the building blocks for the artist's creation:
- **Vertex Data:**This includes information about the 3D object's vertices, such as their position, normal (the direction the surface faces), and texture coordinates (think of them as a map reference for a texture).
- **Textures:** Digital images containing color and detail information, applied to the object's surface like a giant paintbrush.
- **Lighting Data:** Information about the lights in the scene, including their position, color, and intensity, influencing how light interacts with the surface.
- **Output:** The final result of the pixel shader's artistry is a single color value. This value determines the color displayed for that specific pixel on the screen, contributing to the overall visual appearance of your object.

### Properties and Uniforms: The Customization Toolbox

Not all shaders are created equal! Properties and uniforms allow you to inject some much-needed customization into your creations:

- **Properties:** These are variables exposed within Unity's inspector window. You can adjust these properties in real-time to modify the behavior of your shader without diving back into Shader Graph. Imagine properties as dials and sliders the artist can use to fine-tune their work.

- **For example, you might expose a property for a material's "metallic" value, allowing you to adjust its shininess in the inspector.**
- **Uniforms:** These are global variables accessible to all shaders in your scene. They offer a way to share data across multiple shaders, promoting consistency and efficiency. Think of uniforms as shared paint palettes for all the artists working on the scene.

- **For example, you might have a uniform containing the direction of the main light source in your scene, ensuring all shaders react to the light consistently.**

### The Main Function: The Artist's Workshop

Every good artist needs a dedicated workspace – and pixel shaders are no different! The main function acts as the artist's workshop, where the magic happens:

This function encapsulates the core logic of your shader, containing the calculations and manipulations that transform the input data into the final pixel color.
Within Shader Graph, you don't write code explicitly, but you connect nodes that represent these calculations. These nodes might involve:

- **Sampling Textures:** Retrieving color information from specific locations within the texture based on UV coordinates.
- **Lighting Calculations:** Considering light sources and material properties to determine how light interacts with the surface, affecting the final pixel color.
- **Applying Effects:** Implementing special effects like bump mapping, reflections, or custom lighting manipulations, adding artistic flair to the final output.

**By understanding these input and output structures, properties and uniforms, and the role of the main function, you gain a deeper appreciation for the inner workings of a pixel shader. This knowledge empowers you to use Shader Graph even more effectively and create stunning visual effects that bring your Unity projects to life!**
