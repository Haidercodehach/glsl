Welcome to this blog template by [cassidoo](https://cassidoo.co)!

It's using Astro and TinaCMS. You can [clone it on GitHub](https://github.com/cassidoo/blahg) to use it for yourself, and see how it works! I would _love_ if you told me when you do use it, I love seeing variations on it!

The tags at the bottom of the page are dynamically generated. The more tags you use, the more tags are added to the list! Posts are simple markdown files.

You should also check out [my newsletter](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter), or my word game [Jumblie](https://jumblie.com/?utm_campaign=blahgtmp&utm_source=github), or my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/cassidoo). Or don't. Follow your dreams.

Enjoy!
